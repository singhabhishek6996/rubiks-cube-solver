# Rubik's Cube Solver

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a website that solves the Rubik's Cube. The website allows users to input the current state of their Rubik's Cube and provides a step-by-step solution to solve it.

## Features
* User-friendly interface to input the current state of the Rubik's Cube.
* Rubik's Cube visualization to display the current state and the solution.
* Step-by-step instructions to solve the Rubik's Cube.
* Algorithm generator to create new scramble sequences for the Rubik's Cube.

## Technologies Used
The website is built using the following technologies:

* **HTML** and **CSS** for the frontend user interface.
* **JavaScript** for handling user interactions and generating the solution.
* **[Kociemba](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kociemba)** npm package for solving the Rubik's Cube.
* **Three.js** for rendering the Rubik's Cube visualization.
* **Git** for version control and collaboration.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone `https://github.com/singhabhishek6996/rubiks-cube-solver.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd rubiks-cube-solver`
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the local development server.
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the website.

## Usage
